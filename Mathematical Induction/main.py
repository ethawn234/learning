# Proof by sum of natural numbers
# sum_of_n_natural_nums = ( n ( n + 1 ) ) / 2

# the base can be any number, but is frequently 0 || 1

# 1. find/prove the base case
# for n = 0, the sum is 0
# 0 = ( 0 ( 0 + 1 ) ) / 2
# 0 = ( 0 + 0 ) / 2
# 0 = 0
n = 0

# 2. begin induction
def proof_by_induction(n: int) -> bool:
    # create list of n - 1 length
    n_list = []

    b = 0
    n = int([ b + i in n ])


    return False
